  <h1>Markdown image loader</h1>
</div>

**Handles image references involved in markdown files during the webpack processing.**

Highly inspired from the [Webpack: A simple loader](https://bocoup.com/blog/webpack-a-simple-loader) article by [Michael "Z" Goddard](http://zfighting.tumblr.com/tagged/I-MADE-DIS), rewritten with some ES6 flavor, use-case documentation and unit testing.

Additions:

* the loader does not impact references to online images (eg: image path starting with `http://`, `https://` or `//`)
* the loader handles markdown image references with a title

# Installation

Install the `markdown-image-loader` along other webpack development dependencies:

```bash
# via yarn
yarn add -D webpack file-loader markdown-image-loader

# via npm
npm i -D webpack file-loader markdown-image-loader
```

# How it works

In the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) process, this loader etracts image references of markdown documents with a regular expression, then converts them into image file requirements so that the [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) can process them in your build chain.

# Use cases

## Web-based slideshows

This loader was originally designed to quickly setup web-based slideshows using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to build the content, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to produce the static files and [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to display the slideshow with **live-reload**, which can be interesting **when editing the content while interacting with the audience**.

Two full setups are given in the `examples/` folder of this repository:

* [RemarkJS-based slideshow](examples/remarkjs-slideshow/RemarkJS-webpack-setup.md): this use-case was inspired by [Sébastien Castiel](https://github.com/scastiel) (thanks!)
* [RevealJS-based slideshow](examples/revealjs-slideshow/RevealJS-webpack-setup.md): this one is my initiative

Both slideshow examples share the same philosophy, adapted to the technical choices of each framework:

The folder structure of such projects is:

```
dist // folder containing the static files generated by the webpack build (and served by webpack-dev-server)
src
┣ index.html
┣ [your slideshow app name]-slideshow.js
┣ slideshow.md
┣ slides.css // your personal style additions
┣ fonts // folder containing the fonts required in the slides.css file, if any
┣ img // folder containing the images referenced in slideshow.md
┃ ┗ markdown-logo.svg, webpack-logo.svg, etc.
webpack.config.js // involves this markdown-image-loader and the file-loader
package.json // devDependencies to make the slideshow framework and webpack work together
```

* `src/index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- the title header can be dynamically set by bundled-app.js -->
    <title>My slideshow</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- RemarkJS expects the markdown content to be included by the webapp this way -->
    <textarea id="source" style="display: none"></textarea>
    <!-- RevealJS expects the markdown content to be included by the webapp this way -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <div class="slides">
        <!-- horizontal and vertical separators are my choices, tune them as you want -->
        <section data-markdown data-separator="^---" data-separator-vertical="^--">
          <textarea id="source" data-template></textarea>
        </section>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- the bundled webapp will be injected here by the html-webpack-plugin -->
  </body>
</html>
```

* `src/[slideshow app name]-slideshow.js`:

```js
// customize your CSS here
require('./slides.css')

// loads the markdown content with the markdown-image-loader (which processes its image references)
document.getElementById('source').innerHTML = require('./slideshow.md')

// starts the slideshow with a specific configuration object
remark.create({ ... })
// or
Reveal.initialize({ ... })
```

* `src/slideshow.md` (each slideshow engine has its specific syntax, see the slideshow.md files in the examples):

```
# Slide 1 with a jpg reference

![test1](img/test1.jpg)

---

# Slide 2 with an inline png reference

In line ![test2](img/test2.png) image reference.
```

* `webpack.config.js`. Loaders defined in the `module.rules` section are called  from bottom to top: the `file-loader` must be called after the `markdown-image-loader` produces new file requirements:
:

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, 'src', '[slideshow app name]-slideshow.js'),
  output: {
    filename: 'bundled-app.js',
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(svg|png|jpg|gif)$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'file-loader',
            options: {} // produces {hash}.[ext] files by default
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        test: /\.(md|markdown)$/,
        use: 'markdown-image-loader'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* `package.json`. Use the `scripts.build` to produce the static files ready to be served in production, for which you must include these mandatory dependencies in your project: `webpack`, `file-loader` and `markdown-image-loader`. You can optionally include the `webpack-dev-server` to serve your slideshow with live-reload with the `scripts.start` command.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf dist && webpack",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server",
    "lint": "standard"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "file-loader": "...",
    "markdown-image-loader": "...",
    "webpack": "...",
    "webpack-dev-server": "..."
  },
}
```

The outputs generated in the `dist` folder will be:

* the `bundled-app.js` file, handling the markdown content as follows:

```js
// ...
/* 0 */
/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {
module.exports = [
"# Slide 1 with a jpg reference\n\n",
"![test1](" + __webpack_require__(1) + ")",
"\n\n---\n\n# Slide 2 with an inline png reference\n\nIn line ",
"![test2](" + __webpack_require__(2) + ")",
" image reference.\n"
]
/***/ }),
/* 1 */
/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {
module.exports = __webpack_require__.p + "05bf210f71dda8913b3e9ac296da171f.jpg";
/***/ }),
/* 2 */
/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {
module.exports = __webpack_require__.p + "e3989c3353cceb13f5bb1ecf343f22a6.png";
/***/ })
```

* the images referenced by the markdown content, processed by the `file-loader` plugin:
  * the `dist/05bf210f71dda8913b3e9ac296da171f.jpg` file (referenced in slide 1)
  * the `dist/e3989c3353cceb13f5bb1ecf343f22a6.png` file (referenced in slide 2)

# Unit tests

Unit tests can be run with the `npm test` command.
